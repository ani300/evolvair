                    <p>ERA-1 has the opportunity to be one of the most competitive ecologic planes in a period where the main objective of the industry is to reduce the damage-impact in the environment. Thanks to the all-electric systems implementation and the minimization of the weight and noise levels, the “Evolvair” turboprop could receive all the attention from the costumers and become one of the most wanted aircrafts in the market.</p>

                    <p>Taking profit from the higher noise levels that the regional jets emit, the turboprop will be able to control the regional market in the airports located in cities. In addition, the growth of low cost companies and, therefore, the growth of point-to-point operations will favour the manufacture of turboprops in front of the manufacture of regional jets.</p>

                    <p>In both places, Europe and United States, there are routes where airplanes with bigger payloads are not required because of the lack of people. These conditions make the turboprops the best type of aircrafts to be used, as has already been explained in the economic environment where the difference of costs operation between turboprops and regional jets with the same number of passengers is significant.</p>

                    <p>The globalization and the accessibility of flying have caused an increase in the number of regional passengers per year and in the number of seats demanded. That has been translated in a bigger number of aircrafts manufactured and in the rise of the regional market share.</p>
