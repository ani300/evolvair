                    <p>The main strength of the ERA-1 in front of its competitors is also its main design requirement: Its capability to take off and land in less than 1000 meters. Currently, there isn’t any other aircraft with the same (or very similar) passenger capacity that is able to pass said threshold (and with such great margin). Planes with more number of seats need longer runways and the ones that can both take off and land in less than a thousand meters have less passenger and cargo capacity. This allows the ERA-1 to transport a relatively large volume of passengers and to operate in smaller and less crowded airports.</p>

                    <p>One of the most important characteristics of the ERA-1 is precisely the concern for the environment. The design of every part of the aircraft as well as the manufacture process and the use and implementation of both the old and new technologies, aim to reach the highest reliability and energetic efficiency. The world is constantly making efforts on its way to make human activity more sustainable and to lower its harmful effects. These efforts are endorsed by public opinion and it is expected than in the following years many policies will be adopted in both the European Union and the United States of America; policies that may impose tighter requirements on the aircraft industry regarding this issue (it could force operators with other regional aircrafts to adapt their fleet to meet these requirements or even to invest in a new fleet of aircrafts). By adopting this policy and following the Green Regional Aircraft (GRA) recommendations, the ERA-1 hopes to be a leader in its sector of the industry.</p>

                    <p>The estimations regarding the maximal cruise velocity that the ERA-1 could achieve present a quite high value when comparing it with the competitors, this could mean that distances could be covered more rapidly than with other aircrafts. Having faster flights means more flights per day and more flights per day means more income for the operating airline.</p>

                    <p>The cabin is among the longest of the studied turboprop aircrafts. Even though regional flights are not very long, this implies more space for the passengers and a more comfortable experience.</p>

                    <p>The regional aircraft industry has had a great number of successful turboprop airliners throughout its history. Nevertheless, most of them were designed, manufactured and commercialized many years ago and underwent many revisions and improvements until their retirement a few years ago. Some of them still resist, although are scheduled to retire in a not so far away future. There are only a few that either have been designed short time ago or that are currently under development. Since the ERA-1 is currently being designed, it will have implemented many new technologies when compared to the competition that will make it more energetically and economically efficient as well as eco-friendlier. According to different forecasts developed by important regional aircraft companies and associations, the demand of regional aircrafts for the first period of the 2030 decade will be significantly high. The most demanded turboprops will be those with higher passenger capacity than the ones that have been used during the past decades. Nevertheless, it will also be an important demand for regional aircrafts which capacity ranges from 30 to 60 seats, so a “fresh” new product such as the ERA-1 could be very welcomed, and even more given the likelihood of the EU and USA approving new “green” policies for the airline industry (since the demand would increase and because of the characteristics of the ERA-1 mentioned before.)</p>
